            at the intersection of law, ai, and justice, we're making ai accessible for everyone. this is not just my story—it's yours too. let this be our origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            after practicing law for 22 years, I realized that I could help many more people by stepping away from traditional legal practice. my journey has led me to inspire others through the power of ai.

            pragmatism is a philosophical approach that evaluates theories or beliefs in terms of the success of their practical application. in the context of personal and private AI, this means creating systems that are not only effective but also tailored to individual needs, ensuring that technology serves humanity in a meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p>
            personal AI can adapt to individual preferences, enhancing decision-making processes and improving quality of life. private AI ensures that personal data is protected, fostering trust and security in technology. together, they create a framework where technology is not just a tool, but a partner in achieving personal and societal goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            our motto is now pragmatic, personal, private ai, "as above so below," reflecting our commitment to creating a world where technology serves humanity with fairness and equity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            being the love you manifest means creating tools and systems that amplify human potential while maintaining ethical boundaries. it's about using technology to create a more just world, one where everyone has access to the tools they need to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
            join us and be part of this transformative journey. together, we can create a future where technology and justice work hand in hand.
